# [Pandas. Intro to data structures][tutorial]

## Prerequisites

- Non-comprehensive overview of
  the fundamental data structures in pandas.
- The fundamental behavior
  about data types, indexing, and axis labeling / alignment
  apply across all of the objects.
- Here is a basic tenet to keep in mind:
  data alignment is intrinsic.
